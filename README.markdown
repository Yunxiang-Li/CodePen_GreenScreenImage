## Background
This is a very simple Green Screen Image processing program made on CodePen.io according to the [Duke University](https://duke.edu/)'s coursera course [Programming Foundations with JavaScript, HTML and CSS](https://www-cloudfront-alias.coursera.org/learn/duke-programming-web/home/welcome).

## Exhibition

## Install

I only use [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io/) itself in this tiny project.<br>

## Usage

1.Download this repo,open(or zip and open).

2.You may open the **src** folder to check html, css and javascript source codes.

3.You may also access my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/Kitzukikokone/pen/rNOGrzp) to visualize and try the Green Screen Image process directly.

4.You may also build a new CodePen project on your own. Copy my source codes, paste them to relative sections and do your own custom modifications.

**To use this program better, for the left image uploader, try to upload a image with green screen as background and some figures as foreground. For the right image uploader, try to upload a image which will replace the left side image's green screen.**

## Structure

The whole project in Unity contains four main folders, **src** folder, **dist** folder, **Pictures** folder and **Gifs** folder.<br>

Under **Assets** folder, there are altogether 6 subfolders:

```src``` folder stands for source, which means **raw codes** before minification or concatenation or some other compilation - used to read/edit the code.

You can check and modify html, css and javascript codes in ```src``` folder.

```dist``` folder stands for distribution, and is the **minified/concatenated** version - actually used on production sites(CodePen here).

```Pictures``` folder stands for pictures I used in this repo.

```GIFs``` folder stands for GIFs I used in this repo.
